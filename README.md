# CS 230 Portfolio (Bryan Chan)


### Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
- The Gaming Room have asked us to create a web-based version of the game, _Win, Lose, or Draw_.
- The Gaming Room client includes the following requirements:
    - A game will have the ability to have one or more teams involved.
    - Each team will have multiple players assigned to it.
    - Game and team names must be unique to allow users to check whether a name is in use when choosing a team name.
    - Only one instance of the game can exist in memory at any given time. This can be accomplished by creating unique identifiers for each instance of a game, team, or player.

### What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
- When it came to developing this documentation, I did well in evaluating the different options for the server side, client side, and development tools (Windows, Linux, MacOS, and Android/iOS).  

### What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
- Conducting thorough research and drafting an organized evaluation section proved to be helpful.

### If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
- If I could go back, I would revise my recommendations since I believe that the Linux operating system would be a better option than Windows. It could also be improved by including testimonials from various companies attesting to the operating system.

### How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
- The user's needs were interpreted into the software design by making sure that it fit within the context of the entire project. It is important to never deviate from the user's needs and requirements, as it can result in further complications through rejection and project delays. 

### How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
- When it came to designing software, I made sure to stick to the user requirements and to the solution that was mostly compatible with the program. I would utilize the same strategy in a future project, since it would ensure that the project will adhere to the requirements.
